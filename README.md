# operation-TITAN-SHIELD
Files from a Red Team v. Blue Team competition hosted by myself. For now I will not be releasing any other scoring configurations or the actual VMs used in Titan Shield. 

This event was only made possible by a dedicated team of box developers and a robust red team, big s/o to them.
