title = "Project Siren: Establishing Reliable Data Transfer for Monarch's Outposts" 
body = "Project Siren is an initiative undertaken by Monarch to establish a reliable and secure means of data transfer between its various outposts. The project aims to ensure that critical data and information are transmitted efficiently and securely, enabling Monarch's researchers and analysts to better understand and respond to the threats posed by the Titans. The Sedona outpost plays a critical role in studying the MUTO known as Scylla. In order to facilitate the research and monitoring of Scylla, it has become necessary to establish an FTP server at the outpost. This FTP server will allow researchers and analysts to securely transfer data and files related to its behavior and activity. Additionally, an attached text file called emergency_bioacoustics.txt should be stored on the server and used in case of any unexpected incidents or emergencies related to Scylla. By having this FTP server in place, Monarch can ensure that all relevant data and files related to Scylla are easily accessible to the team, while also maintaining the security and integrity of its networks and information."

The project aims to ensure that critical data and information are transmitted efficiently and securely, enabling Monarch's researchers and analysts to better understand and respond to the threats posed by the Titans. It is imperative that we establish an HTTP file server in the Skull Island outpost, where Kong was originally found. This server will allow for the secure sharing of critical data related to the monitoring and tracking of the titan, as well as providing a central repository for important documentation and research findings. To ensure the availability of this important resource, we will also attach a backup file called nuclear_launch_codes.txt in case of any unforeseen circumstances. Please prioritize the establishment of this HTTP file server to ensure the continued success of Monarch's mission to protect humanity from the titans."

title="External Security Audit Results - PART ONE"
body = "A recent external security audit of Monarch's systems has identified several areas of weakness in the organization's cybersecurity measures. As a result, the implementation of stronger authentication protocols is crucial to improve Monarch's overall security posture. To improve security, the first step is to implement SSH key-based authentication for the user vgraham on the bravo and janjira servers. This will ensure a more secure and reliable method of accessing Monarch's systems, protecting the organization's critical data and infrastructure."

title="External Security Audit Results - PART TWO"
body = "A recent external security audit of Monarch's systems has identified several areas of weakness in the organization's cybersecurity measures. Several weaknesses were identified regarding its Yunnan and Skull Island servers. To improve security, the first step is to implement HTTPS for these servers. This will provide a more robust and secure method of communication, helping to protect Monarch's critical data and infrastructure from malicious actors."
